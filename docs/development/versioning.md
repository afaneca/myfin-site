# Versioning

This project follows the guidelines provided by the [Semantic Versioning Specification 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

***
Here's a quick summary of how it works:  
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make **incompatible API changes**
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a **backwards compatible** manner
3. PATCH version when you make **backwards compatible** bug fixes.  
   Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
