# Introduction


## About MyFin

MyFin originated as my own passion project in 2020. At that point, I'd already tried a bunch of other FPM's, but all of
them lacked in at least one of the following points:

- They were not user-friendly
- Their features lacked a full-fledged budgeting tool
- I was never in control of my own data

MyFin is my <u>attempt</u> to solve all of these issues. It has helped me manage my finances for a while now and I hope
it can be useful for you as well.

# Contributing

This was never meant to be anything other than a little passion project of mine. However, if you're interested in taking
this project and make it your own or add something to it, you're more than welcome to do so. Just get in touch :)


## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
