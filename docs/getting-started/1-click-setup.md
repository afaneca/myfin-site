## Automatically deploy to Hostinger
In partnership with Hostinger, you can use the button below to choose your hosting plan.  
Hostinger will automatically set up and launch **MyFin** for you, making this the fastest and simplest option for most users:

[![Deploy on Hostinger](https://assets.hostinger.com/vps/deploy.svg)](https://www.hostinger.com/vps/docker-hosting?compose_url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afaneca/myfin/refs/heads/master/docker-compose.yml&REFERRALCODE=SC1ADNFANHG6)

*Note: The button includes my referral code, which gives me a small commission if you subscribe to a Hostinger plan.*
