# Starting point
MyFin is a **self-hosted** solution. That means that in order for you to use the frontends ([android](https://github.com/afaneca/myfin-android) or [web](https://github.com/afaneca/myfin)) you need to first set up and launch your own instance of the [API](https://github.com/afaneca/myfin) in your own server.

You can get started using MyFin in one of two ways:
- Through Docker or Docker Compose
- Manually installing the api and frontend in your web server/machine
