# Starting point
MyFin is a **self-hosted** solution. That means that in order for you to use the frontends ([android](https://github.com/afaneca/myfin-android) or [web](https://github.com/afaneca/myfin)) you need to first setup and launch your own instance of the [API](https://github.com/afaneca/myfin) in your own server. You can find instructions on how to do that in [the wiki](https://github.com/afaneca/myfin-api/wiki/Getting-started).

You can get started using MyFin in one of 2 ways:
- Through Docker or Docker Compose
- Manually installing the api and frontend in your web server/machine
