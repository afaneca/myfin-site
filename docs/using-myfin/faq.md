# FAQ
## Why do the values from the budget details differ from the evolution stats?
The month's balance value is **calculated differently** in the evolution stats compared to the budget details.

In the budget details:
* Only transactions associated with a category are accounted for
* Transfers for accounts marked as _"exclude from budget"_ are treated as expenses (e.g. loan repayment)
* It gives a **more practical** view of how your expenses compare to your income (for instance, loan repayments, apart from premiums, are actually contributing and adding to your patrimony. However, in practical terms, they still represent an immediate expense that needs to be covered by your income, like any other)

In the evolution stats:
* Doesn't look through the transactions
* Instead, it looks at balance snapshots for all accounts at the beggining of the month and compares them with snapshots from the end of the month. The difference in terms of totals represents the month's balance
* It provides a **more realistic** view of how your patrimony grew (or not) in that specific month

If you see discrepancies between both values, it might be because:
* You have uncategorized transactions
* You have transfers to accounts marked as _"exclude from budget"_ (e.g. loan repayment)
